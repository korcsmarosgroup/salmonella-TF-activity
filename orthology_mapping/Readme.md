***Orthology mapping table***

This mapping table can be used to convert the SL1344 locus tag IDs used for the original PKN to locus targs from other strains and serovars.

Their identity / equivalence was established based on protein orthology developed for the SalmoNet2 database. 

*Brief description of columns:*

- target: target genes of transcription factors given using SL1344 locus tags
- Old_locustag/genename: mapped locus tag or gene name if locus tag was not present for the alternative strain
- Strain_short: strain name (short version)
- Strain_full: strain name (full)
