# SalmonAct: Transcription Factor Activity Inference for Salmonella Transcriptomics

Repository Overview

This repository contains scripts, data, and tutorials to accompany the SalmonAct project, a toolkit for analysing transcription factor activities in _Salmonella_. SalmonAct is a signed and directed prior knowledge network (PKN) tailored for _Salmonella_ transcriptomics, expanding on the SalmoNet2 interaction resource. Developed for compatibility with decoupleR, an R and Python library, this repository enables robust transcription factor activity estimation, aiding researchers in exploring Salmonella biology.

### Key Features:

SalmonAct PKN: A curated network of 4,659 signed, directed interactions involving 167 transcription factors for _Salmonella_.

Data Compatibility: Harmonized interaction data from databases like PRODORIC, CollecTF, and RegulonDB, formatted for decoupleR.

Analysis Scripts: R scripts to replicate differential expression and transcription factor activity analyses shown in the manuscript.
